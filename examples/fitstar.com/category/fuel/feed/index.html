				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Lori Rice — FitStar Contributor</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/05_BBQ_Season.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4932" alt="05_BBQ_Season" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/05_BBQ_Season.png" width="612" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>Summer is officially here and there is no better tool for healthy eating than the grill. It’s a shame that so many of us are forced to store it away for several months a year, but that only makes the summer sweeter. If you are ready to fire it up for the season, these are a few tips I use to keep meals healthy and creative.</p>
<p><b>Reduce Toxins With Herbs </b></p>
<p>Creating rubs and marinades with herbs and spices makes grilled meats more flavorful, but it may also protect us from toxins. Cooking meat at high temperatures forms carcinogenic compounds called heterocyclic amines (HCAs). Research shows that the antioxidants in rosemary prevent these toxins from forming. Similar results have been found with basil, mint, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano and thyme. One of my favorite marinades is orange juice with basil or rosemary. Rosemary and oregano combined with smoked paprika also makes an excellent rub.</p>
<p><b>Food Safety</b></p>
<p>All the safety tips you follow when cooking with raw meats in the kitchen apply to grilling. Wash your hands after handling raw meat. Take raw meat to the grill on one platter and transfer cooked meats to a new, clean platter. Discard marinades and sauces that you have used to baste meats as they cooked. Refrigerate leftovers within two hours, or within one hour if the temperature is greater than 90 degrees F.</p>
<p>With practice, everyone develops their desired cooking time for meats like beef that are often served at different levels of rareness. As a result, many argue that some suggested grilling times are too long, resulting in meat that is too well done. That being said, it is important to know the <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/barbecue-and-food-safety/ct_index" target="_blank">safe minimum internal temperatures</a> set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for meats to reduce the incidence of food borne illness.</p>
<p>-Whole poultry: 165 °F</p>
<p>-Poultry breasts: 165 °F</p>
<p>-Ground poultry: 165 °F</p>
<p>-Ground meats: 160 °F</p>
<p>-Beef, pork, lamb, and veal (steaks, roasts and chops): 145 °F and allow to rest at least 3 minutes</p>
<p><b>Beyond Grilled Meat</b></p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/veggies2.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5423" alt="veggies2" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/veggies2.png" width="574" height="362" /></a></p>
<p>If you think the grill is only for the main course and meat eaters, you are underestimating its potential. Most fruits and vegetables cook well using direct heat for 5 to 20 minutes depending on the food, grill temperature and your desired doneness. They will also need a coating of some type of cooking oil to prevent sticking. Brushing a light layer on both the grill grate and the fruit or vegetable usually does the trick. These are few ways to prepare produce on the grill.</p>
<p>-Grill thick slices of overgrown zucchini for zucchini steaks to serve as a main course or a salad topper.</p>
<p>-Toss on full Portobello mushroom caps for those who don’t want hamburgers.</p>
<p>-Grill thick slices of eggplant and serve with marinara or puree into a dip.</p>
<p>-Chop potatoes and onions, drizzle with olive oil and wrap in foil packets before grilling.</p>
<p>-Grill a combination of peppers, summer squash and onions until tender, roughly chop and dress with a vinaigrette.</p>
<p>-Place a whole head of romaine lettuce on the grill, turn to cook evenly just until warmed and barely wilted. Chop and serve with your favorite dressing.</p>
<p>-Halve and pit peaches and plums and grill cut-side down until warm. Drizzle with honey before serving.</p>
<p>-Grill large pieces of pineapple and sprinkle with cinnamon before serving.</p>
<p>-Grill fruit kabobs with melon, grapes and strawberries. Serve with a yogurt-based fruit dip.</p>
<p>The grill can cook just about any of your favorite foods and provides a healthy way to do so. Whole fish and fish filets, seafood kabobs, pizzas and quesadillas are just a few more ways to step out of the box and get creative with healthy grilling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Darya Rose &#8211; FitStar Advisor</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3039040161_3b2fc59506.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3882" alt="3039040161_3b2fc59506" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3039040161_3b2fc59506.jpg" width="500" height="335" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Mistake #1: Overcooking</strong></p>
<p>By far the most common reason food is ruined is overcooking. When vegetables are cooked too long they lose their vibrant color, sweet flavor and crisp texture, making them far less appealing. Remember that most vegetables can be eaten raw, so cooking should just enhance their flavor and make them a tad easier to chew.</p>
<p>The same is true for meat. Beef, pork, poultry and seafood all taste worlds better when they aren’t burnt to a crisp. Overcooking meat ruins the texture, making it dry, chalky and hard to swallow. Perfectly cooked meat should be tender and juicy. Moreover, meat cooked well done contains more carcinogenic compounds than meat cooked medium rare.</p>
<p>If you source your proteins from high-quality, reliable farms it can be safely cooked to temperatures a few degrees below those recommended by the USDA. They suggest the higher values to protect the meat companies (not you) from being sued for letting their animals bathe in their own feces. Yes, good meat is more expensive. But if you like meat and don’t like <em>E. coli</em> it is an excellent investment. If you do buy industrial meat (or industrial fruits and vegetables for that matter), there is certainly a safety concern and you should be aware of the risks of undercooking.</p>
<p>Solution: Err on the safe side.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid overcooking is to check the food before you expect it to be done. If it’s veggies take sample bites during the cooking process, and don’t be afraid to stop earlier than a recipe says if the taste is good. If it is meat, use a thermometer in the thickest part and pull it off the heat a degree or two before the final temperature. Keep in mind that meat will continue cooking after you pull it from the heat, and be sure to let it rest off the fire for 5-10 minutes before eating. You can always cook something more, but can never cook it less.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake #2: Under-salting</strong></p>
<p>A little salt goes a long way, and sometimes just a pinch can save an otherwise bland and boring dish.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why a healthy eating blog is recommending something that everyone tells us is unhealthy, keep in mind that 75% of the sodium eaten by Americans comes from processed foods. So if you’re cooking fresh food at home you’re already winning the salt war. Besides, if it’s getting you to eat more vegetables then it is a really good thing.</p>
<p>Watch this video for more about the science behind <a href="http://summertomato.com/salt-how-bad-is-it-really-tonight-6pm-pst-on-summer-tomato-live/">how salt affects your health</a>.</p>
<p>Solution: Use a little more salt, then more if necessary</p>
<p>I recommend finding a decent sea salt for flavoring dishes. It adds a dimension and complexity you just don’t get with standard iodized salt. If you’re concerned about the possibility of over-salting a dish but are curious if more salt would help, take out a few bites and sprinkle a little on. You should be able to tell right away if it will help.</p>
<p>Keep in mind though that over-salting can taste even worse than under-salting, and is much harder to fix. Always be careful and just add a little bit at a time until you get the balance right.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake #3: Not enough acid</strong></p>
<p>This one took me awhile to figure out, but it can transform a dish when used properly. Acid adds a slight sourness to foods that can be exceptionally powerful for brightening dull, uninspired dishes. Sour is also the opposite of bitter, so adding a touch of something acidic is usually the best way to fix a dish where the flavors are unbalanced.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>A squeeze of lemon or a dash of vinegar is sometimes exactly what you need to take a dish from just OK to absolutely delicious.</p>
<p><strong>Mistake #4: Using bad ingredients</strong></p>
<p>I saved this until the end because I say it all the time on Summer Tomato, but this is really the most important step.</p>
<p>It’s February and tomatoes couldn’t be any more out of season, so don’t buy them. There are plenty of seasonal ingredients at your local grocery and they will taste worlds better (and be cheaper) than anything artificially ripened and/or shipped from another hemisphere.</p>
<p>Solution: Cook with the seasons</p>
<p>Even if you can’t make it to the farmers market every weekend, you can still find seasonal (if not exactly local) ingredients in your grocery store. If you live in Minnesota and can only find California broccoli this time of year, so be it. But you don’t need strawberries from Chile or tomatoes from a greenhouse in the middle of winter, and they won’t taste good anyway. Here’s a great <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/07/seasonal.food.chart#" target="_blank">seasonal food chart</a> if you don’t know where to start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Darya Rose &#8211; FitStar Advisor</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nuts-533x389.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3877" alt="nuts-533x389" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nuts-533x389.jpg" width="533" height="389" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>“When I work out at the gym, I am there for a couple of hours and by the end of the first hour, I am still energized but start getting hungry. I read your article on <a title="healthy school lunches" href="http://summertomato.com/back-to-school-healthy-packed-lunches/">packing food for lunch</a> but wanted to specifically ask if you recommend any specific store bought bars.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I frequently get questions about different nutrition and energy bars. Generally I think they are a bad idea, since they are usually just processed food with added vitamins and/or other trendy diet ingredients—a hallmark of <a title="Are you eating in the Matrix?" href="http://summertomato.com/are-you-eating-in-the-matrix/">food from the Matrix</a>.</p>
<p>Energy and meal replacement bars serve only one purpose: convenience. Some may be better than others (<a href="http://summertomato.com/food-label-ingredients/">check the ingredients</a> to be sure), but don’t fool yourself into thinking these are health foods.</p>
<p>That said, I understand that quick calories can be incredibly useful, particularly when intense workouts are a regular part of your day. If you get hungry and don’t have anything around to eat, the chances of you breaking down and eating something you’ll really regret increase substantially. But I think there are better things to carry around than energy bars.</p>
<p>My quick snack of choice is nuts or trail mix. I always have a small stash of nuts hidden somewhere in my gym bag (which comes with me everywhere). My personal favorites are almonds, pistachios, cashews and macadamia nuts. When I’m feeling ambitious I’ll combine a few different kinds together in a plastic zipper bag along with some dried fruit, just to mix things up.</p>
<p>One of the only drawbacks of snacking on nuts is if you are really hungry it is easy to eat too many and ruin your appetite for dinner. Too many nuts can also be difficult to digest. To avoid this I recommend getting into the habit of counting the nuts you eat, drinking water and waiting 20 minutes before eating more. The protein and fat in nuts can be very satisfying, but it takes awhile for the satiety signals to reach your brain.</p>
<p>For almonds, cashews and macadamia nuts 10 is a good number to start with. For shelled pistachios and peanuts, 15-20 nuts is more realistic. You are aiming for a single serving size of 1/4 cup. After some practice, eating the proper amount will come naturally to you. But at the beginning you should either count the nuts or measure them out in advance so it is easier to make good decisions.</p>
<p>There are a few other easily transportable foods that can serve as good substitutes for energy bars. Fruit is a great option, particularly filling fruits with lots of fiber like apples and oranges. Be careful with soft fruits, however, or you may end up with a gym bag filled with goo. Yes, I’m speaking from experience.</p>
<p>Another option that I don’t often use but am not opposed to is jerky. Beef and turkey jerky are generally high in protein and very satisfying. Just be careful about the teriyaki flavor that is often high in added sugar.</p>
<p>As a final thought, I wonder if you are maybe spending too much time in the gym? For weight loss and fat burning, more than an hour is really overkill and may actually work against you. If you are training for a specific athletic event, you’ve gotta do what you gotta do. But for the rest of us mortals one hour in the gym is more than enough to accomplish our goals. Maybe your hunger is a signal to you that it’s time to shower up and head home?</p>
<p>One of the most essential aspects of a great healthstyle is planning for moments of hunger throughout your day, but processed foods are hardly ever the answer, no matter how convenient.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Lori Rice — FitStar Contributor<b> </b></p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-veggies.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4794" alt="small veggies" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/small-veggies.png" width="665" height="443" /></a></p>
<p>Vegetables are the foundation of a healthy eating plan. Think about it. It doesn’t matter what eating style you follow – vegetarian, vegan, Paleo, gluten-free, low carbohydrate.</p>
<p>While these plans may give a yay or nay to fruits, grains, dairy or meat, the one thing they all have in common is vegetables. Veggies are nutrient powerhouses, and as important as eating a variety of vegetables is adding some variety to the how they are prepared.</p>
<p>While heat can decrease vitamin C, B vitamins and some antioxidants, it also enhances other nutrients making it easier for the body to absorb them. Heat also destroys some unwanted substances that lurk in otherwise healthy foods. These are a few of the vegetables I often eat cooked, and the reasons why you might want to consider doing the same.</p>
<p><b>Broccoli</b></p>
<p>Raw broccoli maintains its vitamin C levels and cancer-fighting glucosinolates, but don’t be afraid to add it to the steamer. Research shows that steaming broccoli enhances the availability of beta-carotene, and it’s possible that the vitamin C left after cooking is better absorbed than that in raw broccoli. Steaming may also be the best cooking method to reduce heat-related losses of the vitamin and glucosinolates.</p>
<p><b>Collard Greens, Kale and Mustard Greens</b> <b> </b></p>
<p>The ability of food to bind to bile acids leads to cholesterol-lowering potential which reduces risk for cardiovascular disease and some cancers. One <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19083431?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum" target="_blank">study</a> evaluated the bile acid binding ability of cooked versus raw vegetables (including collard greens, kale and mustard greens). Steaming these vegetables improved their ability to bind to the acids boosting their benefit for heart health and their power to protect against disease.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Mushrooms</b></p>
<p>Common white button, portobello and cremini mushrooms contain small amounts of the carcinogen agaritine. While it’s unlikely that we would consume enough mushrooms for the agaritine to have a significant effect on health, cooking these mushrooms can reduce the content. One <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/.U2p3WfldWM0#.U35tDlhdVUw" target="_blank">study</a> showed that when cooking methods such as boiling, baking, microwaving and frying were used, the agaritine in the mushrooms was decreased anywhere from 20 to 70 percent.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mushrooms.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4795" alt="mushrooms" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/mushrooms.png" width="700" height="468" /></a></b></p>
<p><b>Spinach</b></p>
<p>Raw spinach is full of antioxidants, but it also contains more oxalates than other vegetables. Oxalates can interfere with the absorption of calcium. While boiling is not recommended for many vegetables due to nutrient loss, boiling for about one minute is recommended for spinach. This cooking method allows the oxalic acid to leach into the water so that it can be discarded, reducing some of the negative impact on calcium absorption.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Tomatoes</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some argue that a tomato is really a fruit, but it fits in well here with vegetables. Cooking tomatoes boosts their total antioxidant activity. Cooked sauces and salsas, and lightly roasted tomatoes all make it easier for the body to absorb cancer-fighting lycopene.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s important to remember that regardless of the vegetable, cooking for extended periods or at high heat can wipe out nutrients. But a little steaming, microwaving, boiling or grilling can bring out some of the best properties vegetables have to offer. So eat fresh green salads, sliced summer tomatoes and pop some kale leaves into your smoothie, but mix in some vegetable stir-fries and steamed greens, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Darya Rose — FitStar Advisor</p>
<p>For myself and people of my generation, cooking represents the worst kind of irony. Feeding ourselves is our most basic human need, but for some reason no one bothered to tell us how to do it (or even that it was important to learn).</p>
<p>So we grew up, left the house and became dependent on restaurants and instant meals, only to find out 10 years later that this “food” has been killing us slowly.</p>
<p>Now what are we supposed to do?</p>
<p>Learning to cook is important, but can be intimidating if you’ve never done more than boil water, open cans and zap frozen entrees. Navigating the kitchen is much easier if you know a few simple tricks that seasoned chefs take for granted.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3492908124_96d1ee3f40_z.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3915" alt="3492908124_96d1ee3f40_z" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3492908124_96d1ee3f40_z.jpg" width="640" height="319" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Use tongs to cook pretty much everything</strong></p>
<p>Spatulas are awesome for anything that needs to be flipped or scraped, like eggs and pancakes. For everything else, tongs are the way to go. They’re much more nimble and less awkward to use, and you’ll find far fewer things jumping from your pan onto the floor. If you have non-stick cookware, be sure to use tongs with nylon tips. And always go for the 12-inchers.</p>
<p><strong>2. Store everything in tupperware</strong></p>
<p>As much as I’d like to be the kind of person who trims their herbs, puts them in an vase then wraps them in a damp paper towel so they last a week, I’m way too lazy for that. The good news though is that tupperware keeps almost everything fresh for much longer than your crisper, including berries, salad greens and produce that has already been cut. Because it is reusable, it is also more ecofriendly.</p>
<p><strong>3. If you own a knife, don’t use a garlic press</strong></p>
<p>Peeling and pressing garlic is a huge waste of time. To use a clove of garlic, set it on a cutting board and smash it with the flat side of a big knife (any chef’s knife will do). The papery skin will come right off, and you can mince it real quick right there in about 10 seconds. Done.</p>
<p><strong>4. Keep a separate cutting board for things you don’t want flavored with garlic and onion</strong></p>
<p>Assuming you follow any recipe ever, you’ll probably be using your cutting board for cutting onions or garlic. If so, I recommend getting a separate board you keep aside for cutting fruit, cheeses and other things that you’d prefer didn’t absorb the odors of previous meals.</p>
<p><strong>5. Herbs that are supposed to be green should be purchased fresh, not dry</strong></p>
<p>With the possible exception of dried oregano (great in Mexican, Greek and Italian foods), herbs are always better fresh. They’re also cheap and available almost anywhere. In particular, always buy fresh parsley, basil, cilantro, thyme, tarragon or chives if you can help it (a few should be in your fridge at all times). The dried versions are OK if not too old, but they’re very delicate and the jar will probably go bad before you use it twice.</p>
<p><strong>6. Don’t bother with pre-filled spice racks</strong></p>
<p>If you want spices to serve their purpose (making food taste better), you shouldn’t own a pre-filled spice rack. Spices go off quickly, and when their color starts to dull they’ve lost a lot of their flavor. There are several dried spices that are invaluable in my kitchen (cinnamon, cloves, curry powder, cumin, coriander, chili pepper, etc.), but you should purchase them as you need them, and in small quantities unless you use them frequently.</p>
<p><strong>7. Overcooking is probably your biggest kitchen mistake</strong></p>
<p>Overcooked vegetables are mushy and flavorless, overcooked meat is tough and chalky, overcooked grains are soggy and fall apart. In other words, overcooked food is bad food. Learn the art of taking food off the heat just before it is done, and let it finish cooking with its internal temperature. You can always cook it more, but you can never cook it less.</p>
<p><strong>8. If it tastes OK but not great, it probably needs salt—and maybe some vinegar or olive oil</strong></p>
<p>The media loves to bash salt, but I’m not convinced that sodium (rather than processed food) is the real problem. Also, the small amount you use when cooking at home won’t compare to what you’d get at a restaurant or in a packaged meal. Though over-salted food certainly tastes bad, under-salted food is bland and boring and a little dash can often save a dish.</p>
<p>If you think you’ve added enough salt but something is still off, try a <em>small</em> splash of vinegar or lemon (any acid) to brighten the flavor. If the food is dry or sticky, try adding a touch of olive oil. These three things can fix almost any lackluster meal.</p>
<p><strong>9. Don’t buy regular big onions, use shallots or leeks</strong></p>
<p>For most everyday cooking, milder onions will enhance your dish and give it more nuance. Big, strong onions certainly have their place in cooking (soups, roasts, etc.), but most kitchen experiments will be improved by more subtle onion flavor.</p>
<p><strong>10. Fruit (other than berries) shouldn’t be stored in the fridge</strong></p>
<p>Refrigerators dull the taste of most produce, so if you bought something that doesn’t need to go in there leave it out. Most fruits including apples, oranges, pears and bananas don’t belong in the refrigerator unless you’re not planning on eating them soon. I don’t refrigerate tomatoes, avocados or peppers either. Very hot climates are an exception, however.</p>
