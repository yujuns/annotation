				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">It’s Father’s Day and we’re encouraging all the dads to move more! After all, heart disease and diabetes are <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/men/lcod/2010/index.htm">two of the top six causes of male deaths</a>, and both are preventable with regular exercise. The best thing any father can do for his son or daughter is to be healthy and happy. The second best? To pass on the desire to keep active through regular exercise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You know what they say &#8211; a family that FitStars together, stays FIT together! So come on, put dad to the test and do a FitStar workout together. We’ve made all of our Freestyle Sessions FREE this weekend so there&#8217;s no excuse.</p>
<p>It’s easy! Just do your next Program workout together or try one of our 19 fun Freestyle Sessions. Short on time? Give the <a href="http://fitstar.com/7-minutes-of-fitstar/">7-Minute Workout</a> a go, and tack on <a href="http://fitstar.com/10-minute-abs/">10-Minute Abs</a> for an extra core-burn. Looking for something to bring out the competitive spirit? Give <a href="https://app.fitstar.com/redirect?app_url=templates/51bbadf254550727d0000051&amp;web_url=http%3A%2F%2Ffitstar.com%2Fwhy-bodyweight-workouts-are-here-to-stay%2F">Training Camp</a> a go &#8211; it’s an intense 25 minute workout that helps build endurance. Need something a little mellower? Our new <a href="http://fitstar.com/greatist-wherever-workout/">Greatist Wherever Workout</a> is a great lower impact workout that can literally be done&#8230;anywhere!</p>
<p>And if dad likes FitStar, give him a FREE month through our Referral Program. It’s easy, just tell him to <a href="http://support.fitstar.com/customer/portal/articles/1490705-how-do-i-use-my-referral-code-">follow these simple instructions</a>. Be sure to post pictures to our Facebook page of you and your dad (or kids!) exercising with #FitStarStories.</p>
<p>From the FitStar team to your family, we wish you a Happy Father’s Day!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi All &#8211;</p>
<p>Hard to believe, but it has been a year since we officially launched the first version of <a href="http://fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a>.</p>
<p>It started with a simple idea: by making fitness more convenient, inspirational and personal, we could do a better job of getting people moving &#8212; whatever their current state of fitness. In short, we wanted to put a personal trainer on your iPhone.</p>
<p>When we starting looking into consumer fitness options, we saw that DVD workouts really haven’t changed since the original Jane Fonda workouts from 1982. While some do a good job of showing people what to do, they&#8217;re static experiences that don&#8217;t evolve and change with you.  We saw the same phenomenon with other video-based fitness apps and utilities that prevail in the marketplace. Out of this realization, and a lot of hard work, FitStar was born.</p>
<p>Our mission is simple: to inspire people to live healthier lives. And our goal is to revolutionize the way people exercise and deliver a personalized, digital fitness experience that could be used anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>We couldn’t have picked a better debut partner and fitness guru than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Gonzalez_(American_football)">Tony Gonzalez</a>. There&#8217;s nobody we could think of that&#8217;s lived a more authentic life of health &#8211; it shows with his longevity and success on and off the field. We’re grateful he’s a part of our FitStar story, and we&#8217;re just getting started.</p>
<p>The best part of this amazing journey? It’s working. People are using FitStar and getting real results &#8211; while improving their health and well-being. We’ve heard great stories from people around the world of pounds lost and confidence gained. That’s what keeps US motivated.</p>
<p>Watch our &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; <a href="https://vimeo.com/fitstar/review/97476019/d70c5c1854">video</a> for a walk down memory lane.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/97476019" height="281" width="500" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><em>Music credit: Coldplay</em></p>
<p>I’m humbled to say that, to date, well over 1 million people have downloaded the first app developed for our platform: <em><strong>FitStar Personal Trainer</strong></em>, and more than 150 million calories have been collectively burned by our FitStars. As you can see below, we have some really cool, fun stats earned by our users around the world. So today, we celebrate a lot of hard work by our internal team &#8211; but also our dedicated FitStars everywhere. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without you.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1-YearInfoGraphic_FINAL_FULL.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4965" alt="1-YearInfoGraphic_FINAL_FULL" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1-YearInfoGraphic_FINAL_FULL.png" width="560" height="2680" /></a></p>
<p>Thank you for joining us on this journey and we hope you continue to get as much out of FitStar as we put in. There is much more to come.</p>
<p>Mike</p>
<p>CEO/Co-founder</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a> is an ideal solution for getting in a great workout when you’re short on time, but we’re also there for you when you’re short on space. For our latest FreeStyle Session, we teamed up with our friends at <a href="http://greatist.com">Greatist</a> to bring you the <a href="http://greatist.com/move/wherever-workout-video">Greatist Wherever Workout </a>which checks both of these boxes &#8211; while also introducing five new exercises, as well as the return of Warm-Up and Cool Down Moves.</p>
<p>With the Greatist Wherever Workout, you can move through a total-body 20-minute Session in your apartment, dorm, office, outside, or anywhere you’re feeling the fitness. And you can get it done without any equipment, while also taking it easy on your joints and those hardwood floors. That means your neighbors (and your muscles) are going to love these Moves!</p>
<p>You’ll kick things off with a couple Warm-Ups to get your blood moving, and then your fists will be flying with Shadow Boxing &#8211; our latest addition to the Cardio category. Elbow Plank Pushups will chisel your chest while recruiting your core, and Spidermans will make sure your abs and obliques get a little extra love. Back Planks is another simple exercise with a ton of great benefits, including a stronger back, triceps, shoulders, core, and quads &#8211; just make sure you keep those hips high!</p>
<p>Don’t let a lack of time or space stand in the way of your fitness fun &#8211; check out the intro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0tRyJQZngc&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> below and then give the Greatist Wherever Workout a try today. This Session is FREE for all FitStars so there’s no excuse not to Make it Happen!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re all trying to find a little balance in our lives &#8211; why not start with <i>Rock Steady</i>, our latest Premium Freestyle Session? This 20-minute workout focuses on building strong balance and stability &#8211; key foundations for any athletic movement, while also acting as a great way to offset long days spent slouching behind a desk.</p>
<p><i>Rock Steady</i> is designed from a collection of time-based low-impact bodyweight Moves &#8211; a popular community request &#8211; making it ideal for beginners, those with joint pain, or FitStars with neighbors downstairs or a sleeping baby in the next room. And because the exercises are time-based (instead of rep-based), even the most seasoned FitStar can challenge their fitness throughout the 15 different Moves.</p>
<p>From Warrior 3 Kickouts to Superman Planks to Floor Bridge, you’ll get your body’s stabilizer muscles firing, with a little extra burn for your abs, back, legs, and obliques. You’ll be building a better foundation, 20 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>To add a little balance to everyone’s lives, this Premium Freestyle Session will be FREE for all FitStars through April 21st.</p>
<p>Give <i>Rock Steady</i> a try today!</p>
<p>Keep Moving!</p>
<p>-Team FitStar</p>
