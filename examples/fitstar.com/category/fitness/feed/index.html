				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a bird, it’s a plane &#8211; it’s the <strong>Superman Plank</strong>! If you’re not already seeing this alternative take on the traditional plank in your current Program, check it out in the <a href="http://fitstar.com/10-minute-abs/">10-Minute Abs</a> or <a href="http://fitstar.com/alpine-blitz/">Alpine Blitz </a>Freestyle Sessions to really test your midsection mettle.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Superman-Planks-Tony.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5375" alt="Superman-Planks-Tony" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Superman-Planks-Tony.jpg" width="614" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>Solid form is a big key to helping you get the best results with <a href="http://fitstar.com/download">FitStar Personal Trainer</a>. So, we’ve rolled out another FitStar Fundamentals video with our very own John Rafferty and NASM-certified trainer Long Vo to show you how to properly perform the Superman Plank.</p>
<p>With equal parts, ab strength, oblique strength, balance, and flexibility, Superman Planks can be a solid core component to any stomach-strengthening routine. (See what we did there?)</p>
<p>This compound exercise takes a bit of practice, but John and Long break down the basic movements step-by-step in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBeHQBD_SLM">video</a> to ensure you’ll be flying high with abs just like the Man of Steel.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FBeHQBD_SLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>If there are any Moves you’d like to see covered in a future FitStar Fundamentals video, please leave us a comment below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Jeff Angus – FitStar Contributor</p>
<p>Over the past three weeks, I have covered <a href="http://fitstar.com/specificity/">Specificity</a>, <a href="http://fitstar.com/progressive-overload/">Progressive Overload</a>, and <a href="http://fitstar.com/recovery/">Recovery</a>, as they are some key elements to reaching your fitness goals. This week, I end the health maximums series with: Consistency.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Consist-Pic-Small-.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4633" alt="Consist Pic Small" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Consist-Pic-Small-.jpg" width="434" height="256" /></a></p>
<p>Spending time putting the “perfect” program together, with a very specific number of sets, reps, rest times, progressions, and so on, is great in theory, but how applicable is it to real life? What happens if you miss a workout? Have you ruined all of your hard work? Do you have to start all over?</p>
<p>You should always enter the gym (or your exercise venue of choice) with the mindset to put in hard work. But you should never chase perfection, because you will just wind up frustrated. Instead, find out what works for you <b>and do your best to maintain both simplicity and consistency with your training (and especially your diet).</b></p>
<p>When I asked elite athletic trainer Andy O’Brien what set his client (and NHL superstar) Sidney Crosby apart from others, he didn’t immediately point to Crosby’s speed, power, strength, or stamina. It was his consistency.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In 12 years of working with him, he’s never missed a workout, and he’s never given anything less than his best effort.  He has a remarkable way of bringing his “A” game on a daily basis, which requires tremendous focus, determination, and mental toughness.  He’s extremely bright and very serious about his performance.&#8221; </i>(Read the full interview <a title="Jeff Angus blog interview" href="http://www.anguscertified.com/an-interview-with-fitness-guru-andy-obrien/">here</a>)</p>
<p>Obviously elite athletes such as Crosby will require some level of complexity in their programs. The closer to the top you get in a given athletic endeavor, the harder it becomes to achieve incremental improvements. But the significant majority of the population doesn’t need the most complex or detailed workout program in the world. More often than not, the best results come from sticking to a set of guidelines for at least a few months (not minutes or hours or days). The squat rack is busy? Do some lunges or step-ups instead. Learn to adapt and make the best of any situation.</p>
<p><b>The Pareto principle, or the 80/20 rule, is a great one to follow for both fitness and nutrition.</b> Eat well 80% of the time, and the rest takes care of itself. Dial in 80% of your workout program, and enjoy the other 20% – have a day set aside to have some fun in the gym, try new exercises, or get outside and do a workout at the park or go for a hike. Finding balance isn’t just important; it is essential to any long-term fitness success. You simply can’t train 100% all the time –overtraining (which is a swear word in the fitness industry as far as I’m concerned) leads to mental and physical burnout, injury, hormonal imbalance, and a bunch of other bad stuff.</p>
<p>From Steve Kamb of Nerd Fitness:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Simplicity is important because it’s so easy to overcomplicate things, and suffer paralysis by analysis.  Being honest, the best workout is the workout that you actually follow consistently.  On top of that, workouts that are super simple can often be the most effective.  You can work out your entire body with three movements: squat, overhead press, and pull ups.  Not glamorous, but incredibly powerful, easy, and effective.  Keep it simple!&#8221; (</i>Read the full article <a href="http://www.nogym.net/zen-of-simplicity/" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>Rome wasn’t built in a day. True body composition improvements don’t come instantly. And the ones that do are either very unhealthy and/or very unsustainable. The person who sticks to a decent program for three months will see much better results than the guy who trains inconsistently for three months while following a world-class program designed for him by a fantastic coach. This means learning to train around injuries (while actively working to recover, of course). And learning to train when you may not feel 100%. Tired, sick, whatever.</p>
<p><b>How to Keep Things Simple:</b></p>
<p>If you want to add strength and/or size, focus on the compound lifts first – squats, deadlifts, pull-ups, pushups, and so on. Don’t worry about the accessory lifts (bicep curls, lateral raises) unless you have the time and desire to add them on.</p>
<p>If your goal is to get faster, work on speed and power exercises. This ties in to what I have been saying throughout this series – <b>figure out your goal FIRST</b>, and work back from there. Long-term goal setting is a requirement for any fitness program if you want to ensure accountability to yourself (and perhaps a coach or training partner). Goals can be general – “I want to get faster/bigger/leaner” – but typically they are more effective the more specific they are.</p>
<p><b>Some More Tips For Simplicity:</b></p>
<p><b>Have a “deload” or “recovery” week every four weeks</b></p>
<p>Progress from week 1 to week 2, and week 2 to week 3 (more weight, less rest time, more volume – again, depending on your goal and what works best for your schedule), and then dial things back for week 4. You don’t need to take the week off, but reduce the volume of your workouts or try other forms of exercise to give your brain a break.</p>
<p>And then start a new four week cycle after. Here is a quick example to illustrate this point. Let’s say you squat 150 pounds for 5 reps and 3 sets for week 1. Maybe you add a fourth set for week 2, and a a fifth set for week 3. Then in week 4, you drop it back to one or two sets. And when the next cycle starts, you bump your weight up to 160 or 170 pounds.</p>
<p><b>Focus on a few lifts you want to get better at</b></p>
<p>I’d recommend pushups, squats, deadlifts, and pullups. Focus on getting better at these four lifts, and you will make gains.</p>
<p>-Learning the perfect <a title="Front squat" href="http://www.anguscertified.com/learning-the-front-squat/" target="_blank">front squat</a></p>
<p>-Learning the perfect <a title="pushup" href="http://www.anguscertified.com/why-you-should-do-weighted-pushups/" target="_blank">pushup</a></p>
<p>-Learning the perfect <a title="pull-ups" href="http://www.anguscertified.com/why-you-should-do-weighted-pull-ups/" target="_blank">pull-up</a></p>
<p>-Learning the perfect <a title="trap bar dead lift" href="http://www.anguscertified.com/learning-the-trap-bar-deadlift/" target="_blank">trap bar dead lift</a> (an easier variation for many people than a standard Olympic bar)</p>
<p><b>Avoid information overload and focus</b></p>
<p>Don’t try to combine programs. Don’t get bogged down in the details. Pick a program designed by a reputable coach, and stick to it. Jim Wendler’s 5/3/1 is a fantastic program for size and strength gains. And it’s really simple to follow.</p>
<p>“Can I still do core seven days a week while on a restrictive diet and while trying to improve my strength and power?” This is an example of a ridiculous goal. Pick one thing and follow it.</p>
<p><b>How to Keep Things Consistent:</b></p>
<p>Consistency is a skill. And,  just like any skill, it needs to be practiced regularly. You won’t “become consistent” in a day or two. Start small, and work your way towards a bigger goal. You aren’t going to build a killer physique by eating clean, sleeping eight hours a night, and working out really hard in the gym in just two weeks. But if you do that over 52 weeks… you will. There are no quick fixes in fitness. People don’t want to hear that (which is why the supplement industry rakes in the $$$ every year), but consistency is the answer.</p>
<p>You get out what you put in. Master the important lifts. Figure out your goals, your ideal eating strategy, and a way to minimize stress in your life. <b>Chasing perfection is a fruitless endeavor. </b><b>But chasing consistency isn’t.</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Jeff Angus – FitStar Contributor</p>
<p>Continuing with the Health Maxims series, this week I will be covering Recovery, a vital step to address in your fitness journey. Make sure to check out the first two: <a href="https://fitstar.com/specificity/">Specificity</a> and <a href="https://fitstar.com/progressive-overload/">Progressive Overload</a> to help you achieve your goals the smart and healthy way.</p>
<p>Adequate rest and recovery is vital to any fitness/exercise program. Overtraining is just as harmful as under-training (and potentially more damaging to your long term health). You don’t actually make any strength/size/fat loss improvements while working out. They come while you are resting and recovering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Recovery_small.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5040" alt="Recovery_small" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Recovery_small.png" width="718" height="370" /></a></b></p>
<p><b>The Recovery Principle – Why?</b></p>
<p>You can eat healthy and still make gains on a sub-par workout program, <b>but you can’t out-train a bad diet. Period.</b> Getting into the gym for three or four hours a week isn’t too hard for most people. And some even enjoy pushing themselves to get bigger, stronger, and/or faster. However, it is the other 23 hours of the day where the improvements are made. And you can’t “do an extra hour of cardio” to work off the crappy dinner you ate last night. Things just don’t work that way, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Diet, rest, and recovery are all important pieces of health and wellness, but they are often considered as secondary in terms of importance compared to training. You need to rest and recover in order for adaptation to take place. Assuming your workout program is specific to your goals and you are applying the principle of progressive overload to challenge your body, you will see positive changes with proper rest and recovery.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Ignoring rest in a chronic manner is a surefire recipe for disaster. Athletes have lifting and conditioning sessions, practices and actual contests, so it should come as no surprise that given poor program design, they can become legitimately overtrained more “easily” than the ordinary weekend warrior. Coaches need to understand not only how to manipulate volume and loading, but also how to appropriately integrate back-off weeks and recovery methods.&#8221; - <a title="Eric Cressey" href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_repair/10_mistakes_coaches_make" target="_blank">Eric Cressey</a><br />
</i></p>
<p><b>The Recovery Principle - How?</b></p>
<p>How long should you rest? Between sets and reps? Between workouts? There are a lot of different answers, as it depends on how hard you are training, how much time you have available to train, as well as several other variables.</p>
<p>Here are some very basic/general rules to follow (again, none of this is set in stone, and you will probably read different answers from different sources – but this is a pretty good set of guidelines to follow).</p>
<p><b>Sets and Reps:</b></p>
<p><b></b>-If you are training for strength or power (five or less reps with a heavy load), rest at least 2-3 minutes between sets.</p>
<p>-If you are training for hypertrophy/muscle gain (six to 12 reps with a medium-to-heavy load), rest for 30-60 seconds between sets.</p>
<p>-If you are training at anything above 12 reps, you don’t need to rest very long between sets (it is essentially aerobic/cardio work with weights).</p>
<p>-And make sure to <a title="warm up" href="http://www.tonygentilcore.com/blog/the-perfect-warm-up/" target="_blank">warm up </a>and <a title="cool down" href="http://robertsontrainingsystems.com/blog/qa-is-static-stretching-good/" target="_blank">cool down</a> properly</p>

</div>
<p><b>Time Off Between Workouts:</b></p>
<p>It really depends on how hard you are training and how much time you have available. You can make significant gains in the gym with three sessions per week (40-45 minutes in duration, provided you work both smart and hard).</p>
<p>If you are doing bodyweight training or are new to fitness, you don’t need to take more than 24 hours off between workouts.</p>
<p>But as your fitness level increases and the weights and difficulty of your workouts increases, you will notice your body is slower to make improvements/changes. More (and proper) rest and recovery will be very beneficial. Alternating workout days and days off is a simple and easy protocol to follow.</p>
<p>Again, there are so many ways to structure your workouts. You could go with three full body workouts per week. You could do upper and lower body splits. You could do bodybuilding splits, focusing on a certain muscle group or two each workout. <b>Again, figure out what your goal(s) are before doing anything else.</b></p>
<p>And you need to find a way to have a <a href="http://robertsontrainingsystems.com/recover/" target="_blank">recovery/deload week</a> every 4-6 weeks (again, depending on how frequent and intense your training schedule is).</p>
<p>This is characterized by a decrease in training volume (generally 60% of your highest training week), and a slightly reduction in intensity, or weight used, as well.  For example if you’re doing 3×10 in your highest volume week, you could perform 2×10 in your deload, or 3×6.</p>
<p>More on recovery weeks from <a title="more on recovery weeks" href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/program_design_101" target="_blank">T Nation</a>:</p>
<p><i> There are two main reasons why you need planned recovery weeks in your training:</i></p>
<p><i></i><i> 1. Your body needs time to adapt to the prior training stimulus.</i></p>
<p><i>2. Your training incurs long-term fatigue, so by giving yourself  a recovery week you’re allowing your body to realize the gains it’s made but isn’t showing yet.</i></p>
<p>There are also mental benefits to a rest/recovery week. You simply can’t make gains in the gym every single workout or week, and at some point you are going to suffer from mental fatigue and/or burnout. Rest weeks are a great way to recharge the batteries and regain motivation to exercise.</p>
<p><b>Importance of Sleep:</b></p>
<p>Here are some useful tips from trainer Mike Robertson on how to improve your <a title="sleep" href="http://robertsontrainingsystems.com/blog/sleep-101/" target="_blank">sleep</a>. The evil cousin of sleep is a lack of sleep, and that leads to a lot of bad things. Some of them include:</p>
<p>-Reduced testosterone in males.</p>
<p>-An increase in cortisol (the <a title="Cortisol article" href="http://robertsontrainingsystems.com/blog/stress-the-real-epidemic/" target="_blank">stress hormone</a>… and not a good thing).</p>
<p>-Reduced insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>I’d also highly recommend reading <a title="sleep study" href="http://www.ericcressey.com/sleep-what-the-research-actually-says" target="_blank">this study</a> of sleep by the creators of Examine.com. Really fascinating stuff.</p>
<p><b>Dialing in Your Nutrition:</b></p>
<p>Just like training, the best diet is the one that you will actually follow. Having an incredibly complex and regimented diet may look great and work in theory, but is it real world applicable? You still want to actually enjoy food (and life).<b></b></p>
<p><b>Recovery Tools:</b></p>
<p>Learn how to <a title="myofascial release" href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_repair/feel_better_for_10_bucks" target="_blank">myofascially release </a>yourself (not as fun as it sounds). You will feel better, move better, and save a ton of money on massages and doctor visits. Kelly Starrett from the MobilityWOD is my go-to resource for learning how to take care of your body, and I can’t recommend his book <a href="http://www.suppleleopard.com/" target="_blank">“Becoming a Supple Leopard”</a> enough. The guy is a genius, and he makes things really simple and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Kelly’s website is now one that requires a subscription, but he still has hundreds of free (and incredibly insightful) videos in his <a href="http://www.mobilitywod.com/episodes/">archives.</a></p>
<p>I’d recommend picking up a “grid” foam roller. They are hollow (easy to travel with) and very durable. Learning how to foam roll is pretty easy – it’s essentially the same principle of a deep tissue massage – you put a lot of pressure on muscle “knots” and break up crappy tissue in order to improve how your body feels and moves.</p>
<p><b>In conclusion:</b></p>
<p>It is important that you understand the recovery principle, why it is beneficial, and how to implement it properly. Take care of your issues before you need to get surgery or before they prevent you from exercising and enjoying fitness. And you need to understand that your body actually makes gains and improvements when you aren’t in the gym. Your body adapts to the demands/stresses you place on it. Fuel it properly, give it rest, stretch, foam roll, and you will be good to go.</p>

<p>This week I want to share another one of the Four Health Maxims that are vital to your fitness success: <strong>Progressive Overload</strong>. You can read about Specificity, the first one in this series <a href="https://fitstar.com/specificity/">here</a>. And be sure to follow the <a href="http://fitstar.com/blog/" target="_blank">FitStar Blog</a> for other great tips and motivation to help on your health journey.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/progressive-overload-pic-copy.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4824" alt="progressive overload pic copy" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/progressive-overload-pic-copy.jpg" width="800" height="448" /></a></b></p>
<p><b>What is Progressive Overload?</b></p>
<p><em>Progressive</em> – Happening or developing gradually or in stages; proceeding step by step</p>
<p><em>Overload</em> – to load to excess; overburden</p>
<p>Progressive Overload is applied to all kinds of training. Essentially, you want to continue to make things harder. That’s the layman’s definition. And there are an infinite number of ways to accomplish that. More weight, more repetitions, more sets, less recovery time, less stability, and so on.</p>
<p>An Olympic sprinter wants to get as fast as possible. A hockey player wants to get as powerful as possible without adding too much mass. A sumo wrestler wants to add as much mass as possible without sacrificing strength. The average gym goer wants to build a healthy and aesthetically appealing body in a few hours a week. And each of them will train very differently. But all of them need to continually challenge themselves if they want to make consistent improvements over the medium-to-long-term.</p>
<p>Let’s say you start off lifting 50 pounds &#8211; ideally, you won’t be lifting the same 50 pounds a year later (assuming you are consistent with your training). Your body adapts to that weight, and it becomes stronger and better able to move the weight. So next week you may be able to lift 55 pounds. And the week after, it might be 60. Many people get comfortable with their training and they fail to apply progressive overload – this isn’t the end of the world if you are just starting out with a fitness program, as your body will see improvements with almost anything you do. However, as you improve your strength or fitness level, it becomes harder to make improvements. <b>The human body is very, very good at finding the path of least resistance.</b> Once it becomes good at something, it finds the easiest way to complete the movement.</p>
<p>This is why marathon runners have much lower heart rates when running than the average person. Their cardiovascular systems are so much stronger and so much more efficient at processing oxygen. But if you put a marathon runner outside of his or her comfort zone (power lifting, for example), they will struggle and get fatigued quite quickly.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget to enjoy the gains you make in your first few months of training.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;If you’re a beginner, sit back and enjoy the ride! Your rate of strength gain during your first three months of proper weight training will be higher than at any other time in your life. Each week you will slaughter personal records. Getting fifteen reps with something that you got for only ten reps the previous week is not an uncommon occurrence. This is mostly due to rapid gains in intermuscular coordination. Just don’t get spoiled, your rate of gain will slow dramatically and pretty soon you’ll be just like the rest of us – fighting like hell for those PR’s.&#8221; </i>(Read the full article by Bret Contreras <a href="http://bretcontreras.com/progressive-overload/">here</a>)</p>
<p><b>Is Progressive Overload Essential?</b></p>
<p>In a word – no. Progressive Overload isn’t essential. You won’t shrivel up into a muscleless ball if you don’t continually challenge yourself in the gym. You can do the same workout routine every single day, and you are still better off than the person doing nothing at all. But, at some point, you will plateau and improvements will slow to a halt. The same applies to dieting, too. The first few pounds come off really easily, but as you get closer to your target weight, each pound becomes exponentially harder to shed than the last.</p>
<p>Your body is smart, and you need to continually find ways to surprise it.</p>
<p><b>How To Implement Progressive Overload:</b></p>
<p>Here are a few tips – some will be more relevant to you depending on your fitness level.</p>
<p><b>1. Start with body weight first </b></p>
<p>If you can’t do 10-15 proper pushups, you shouldn’t be on the bench press. Period. Learning to control your body before applying external resistance is vital for injury prevention, proper muscular recruitment, and long term size and strength gains.</p>
<p>Pick up Kelly Starrett’s “<a title="How to Build the Supple Leopard" href="http://www.suppleleopard.com/">How to Build the Supple Leopard</a>” and learn how to do a pushup, a pullup, a squat, and a deadlift. Once you have the bodyweight variations down, start to add weight (progressive overload). You need the base/foundation in place first.</p>
<p>And yes, bodyweight exercises will build strength and muscle at the beginning. Once you can do 20-30 pushups (or 20-30 good squats), you won’t see the same gains any more (as, once again, your body has adapted to your bodyweight). Time to make things harder.</p>
<p>And never sacrifice quality of movement just to add more weight on the bar.</p>
<p><b>2. Use free weights</b></p>
<p>I think this is pretty much common knowledge than it used to be, but don’t use machines. They aren’t functional at all, and unless you are training for a bodybuilding show, you are going to see better strength gains using free weights (kettlebells, dumbbells, barbells).</p>
<p><b>3. Recover! Use what I like to call, a deload week</b><b> </b></p>
<p>Be careful not to over-train. Every four or five weeks, it is important to take a recovery week from your training. In the short term, this may seem counter-intuitive. More time in the gym means more gains, right? Well, not exactly. You don’t actually make any improvements in the gym – they come from your rest and recovery (adequate nutrition, recovery time, and proper sleep). Even if you are very out of shape, it is good to establish proper training habits early on.</p>
<p>For a recovery week, you don’t have to avoid the gym all week. Simply decrease the volume and/or intensity of your workouts. a great time to work on mobility and any nagging injuries you may have, as well. And when you get back to the gym training hard again, you will be motivated, more energized, and surprised at the fact that you actually gained more strength and muscle during your week off.</p>
<p><b>4. Add more volume</b></p>
<p>This one is pretty straightforward. Add more sets or reps to your workout routine. You can either choose to make your workouts longer, or you can concurrently cut down the rest/recovery time (more on that in a bit) and get more work done in the same amount of time (increasing training density).</p>
<p>If you start off doing two sets, add a third in. For strength/power training, your reps are generally between 1 and 6. Because of this, you will be doing at least three sets, and likely many more (to ensure sufficient volume). But if you are training for general fitness purposes and stick to a rep range of 6 to 12, you don’t need to do more than three sets of any given exercise. It won’t kill you to add a fourth set, but after three there tends to be diminishing returns. <a href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/the_setrep_bible">Here’s more on choosing the right number of sets and reps depending on your goal(s).</a></p>
<p><b>5. Add more resistance </b></p>
<p>There are so many ways to do this. <a title="Linear periodization" href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/maki4.htm">Linear periodization</a> (a set increase from week to week), <a title="nonlinear periodization" href="http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/nonlinear_periodization_for_size_and_strength">non-linear periodizaton</a>, pyramid or reverse pyramid training (different ways to structure your sets and reps within a given workout), and so on. Again, don’t overcomplicate things. Find what works for you, and stick to it. Don’t change the set/rep scheme every week.</p>
<p><b>6. Decrease rest/recovery time </b></p>
<p>This is a fantastic way to apply progressive overload if you don’t have access to a gym or you aren’t worrying too much about how much weight you lift or how big you get. This can even be applied to bodyweight training. Say, for example, you have a workout routine you really like. You go to the gym, you cycle through five or six exercises a few times, and you come home. You probably aren’t timing your rest/recovery periods, are you?</p>
<p>Well you should be. Unless you are working in the 1-8 rep range, you don’t need to be resting for more than 60 seconds between sets. Say you start the first few weeks with 60-second recovery intervals. Your body becomes better at adapting to that minute.</p>
<p>So when you want to make things more difficult, instead of upping the weight or difficulty of exercise, you drop that recovery time down to 45 or 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Another way to apply progressive overload to this is to use a heart rate monitor (this is also a great tip for interval training). Say your heart rate gets up to 155 when you are doing a particular exercise. Instead of using a set time for your rest, wait until it drops to a particular number – 130, for example. You will notice that as you get stronger and fitter, your heart rate will drop a lot quicker (one of the many benefits to exercise). So the recovery periods will naturally decrease as you get fitter with this technique.</p>
<p><b>In Conclusion:</b></p>
<p>This post was meant to be relatively comprehensive, but at the end of the day, don’t forget the overriding rule that applies to almost everything in fitness (and life) – K.I.S.S. (keep it simple, stupid). Don’t waste your time writing up the most technically sound/perfect program ever. Life has a way of mucking things up – so find out what works for you, be consistent, diligent, and smart with it, and make it harder once you find yourself adjusting.Progressive overload is an important principle to understand. And once you have it figured out, you can easily apply it to anything you do.</p>
<p>Consistency, simplicity, and hard work. The ingredients to getting (and staying) in great shape.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Jeff Angus – FitStar Contributor</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I will be sharing my four favorite fitness and health maxims with you: <strong>specificity</strong>, <strong>recovery</strong>, <strong>consistency</strong>, and <strong>progressive overload</strong>. Regardless of your current fitness level or your health goal(s), these four maxims are vital to creating and sustaining a successful and enjoyable long-term exercise plan.</p>
<p><b>What Is Specificity?</b></p>
<p><b>Specificity is the principle of training that states what you do in the gym should be relevant and appropriate to your desired outcome</b>. Training must go from general (at the beginning) to specific (as the program progresses).</p>
<p>For example, a typical NHL player will begin the off-season correcting any injuries or general movement issues from the previous season of wear and tear. By the end of the summer, that player will be skating again and working primarily on speed and power improvements that are very specific to skating and playing hockey.</p>
<p><b>Specificity</b> also implies that to become better at a particular exercise or skill, you must perform that exercise or skill. To become a good cyclist, you must get on your bike a lot. The point to take away is that a runner should train by running and a swimmer should train by swimming. But if you are just training to get stronger or in better shape, how can you use specificity to aid your progress?</p>
<p>As Aristotle said, excellence isn’t an act but a habit. You are what you repeatedly do. Don’t expect to get faster if you are only bench pressing, and conversely, don’t expect your bench press to get better if you are only doing hill sprints.</p>
<p>Most people ignore the specificity principle when putting together their own workout programs (or even worse, when aimlessly going to the gym a few times a week). Don’t get me wrong, <b>doing something active is better than nothing</b>, but if you are in the fitness game for the long haul, you need to set some specific goals to stay engaged, track progress, and enjoy the journey.</p>
<p><strong>Why Does This Matter?</strong></p>
<p>Because there is never going to be a day when you are fully and completely satisfied with your fitness level and decide to “quit” exercising. <b>There is no end date to health.</b></p>
<p>Charles Poloquin, known in fitness circles as the godfather of program design, offers his specificity principle definition: &#8220;<i>Specificity refers to developing a particular athletic quality in the manner in which it occurs in a particular sport.&#8221;</i><i> </i></p>
<p>Obviously the better you get at a sport, the more specific your training has to be. The weekend warrior or the average person just wanting to get “in shape” doesn’t need to have workouts that are as specific as an NHL player for a professional power lifter.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Specificity-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4654" alt="Specificity 1" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Specificity-1.jpg" width="434" height="241" /></a></p>
<p>For training to be effective, it should be similar to the demands of the sport. Usually, the more specific the training, the better the transfer to sports performance. Although that last statement may be true, many strength and conditioning professionals including myself believe non-specific training should also take place in a training program not only to achieve a higher level of ability but for also injury prevention. Keep in mind, training first started to prevent injury, and later professionals discovered that training can also improve performance.</p>
<p><b>Let’s Look At A Few Examples: </b></p>
<p>If you want a big and strong chest/upper body, there aren’t many better exercises than the bench press (or <a title="weighted pushups" href="http://www.anguscertified.com/why-you-should-do-weighted-pushups/">weighted pushups</a>). But hockey players and baseball players don’t need to bench press on a regular basis. In fact, for many baseball players, there are underlying shoulder issues (mostly related to overuse) that make the bench press a potentially dangerous exercise.</p>
<p>And while having specific exercises helps in terms of improving sport performance, there are general or global demands that all human beings – regardless of their fitness pursuits – need to have. General strength and power, good posture and core stability, and mobility and stability at all of the major joints are all requirements to a healthy and functional body, especially in an athletic environment. Almost any person on Earth stands to benefit from squatting (with different variations, loads, and intensities, of course) and/or deadlifting.</p>
<p>Another example – to get a stronger wrist shot, many people think they need to be doing wrist curls. Specific? Sure. But effective? Not really.</p>
<p>All human beings squat and deadlift every single day (they just don’t know it). Picking up a box? That is a deadlift (usually with bad form). Getting up or sitting down? Hello box squat. Starting your lawn mower? That is a single arm row, using both back and core muscles to generate rotational power. Carrying groceries in from the car? That is a farmer’s walk, which places a huge demand on the core and upper back.</p>
<p><b>The Trade-Off Of The Specificity Principle:</b></p>
<p>However, there is always a trade-off with the specificity principle. If you are focusing on a particular sport or movement, you are going to neglect other areas of fitness. For example, if you only train in the endurance repetition range (higher reps, lighter weights), you won’t make significant strength or hypertrophic gains. And if you are training to squat or deadlift as much as you can, you won’t improve on your 10k time as much as if you were doing intervals, speed work, and higher repetition training with weights.</p>
<p><strong>Simply put, you have to focus on something during your workouts if you want to see long term gains</strong>. If you are new to the gym, you will see improvements doing almost anything, as your body isn’t used to having to work very hard. But once you make some progress, it becomes harder to break through each plateau. And this is where the specificity principle and goal-setting both come in to play.</p>
<p><b>Some Thoughts From Dean Somerset:</b></p>
<p><i>Workout consistently with a goal in mind. Stick with a program for at LEAST a few weeks to see noticeable progress. Switch it up when you want to work on something else, or when your gains start to stall (you’ll see this with a workout journal where you can record your lifts, weights, etc, and see if you’re making progress or not). Any program you do will get you results, IF it focuses on specific adaptation to imposed demands, and NOT if it focuses on non-existent terms like “muscle confusion.”</i></p>
<p><b>How To Get Specific:</b></p>
<p>Hopefully you haven’t been lulled to sleep just yet. How can you make your training specific? Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<p><b>1. Find a good gym in your area, and go in for a fitness assessment.</b> If possible, do some reading on the coach or trainer first to see their credentials or background. An assessment (like the Functional Movement Screen, or many coaches have developed their own) will show you your weak points and what you need to improve on to avoid injury. The Fit Test within <a href="http://www.fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a> is also a good starting point and will recommend a program you can start doing on your own within the app.</p>
<p><b>2. Pick a goal or two.</b> If you want to become a better runner, focus on exercises that will help with that. If you want to get ripped for the beach, focus on hard, full-body conditioning workouts (and clean up your diet… stat).</p>
<p><b>3. Track your progress</b>. Weekly or biweekly pictures are a great way to do this. The camera doesn’t lie (the scale, contrary to popular belief, often does). Write down your workouts – what exercises you did, what weights you used, and how you felt during and after. This is another way to tangibly see your progress.</p>
<p>Why I don’t like the scale – your weight has little to do with health and body composition (assuming you aren’t obese). You could weigh 160 pounds and be severely out of shape, and after a year of training and eating well, you could add 15 pounds of muscle and be a much healthier 175 or 180 pounds.</p>
<p><b>4. KISS. Keep It Simple, Stupid.</b> The more complex your training program, the less likely you are to follow it. You don’t need to do 10 to 12 exercises every time you go in the gym. And you don’t need to time your rest periods down to the second (unless you are an elite athlete). Learn the important lifts from a trainer or coach (or a friend), and get really good at them. If you have extra time, you can add in the accessory work – bicep curls, and so on. But that stuff isn’t essential.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Cyrus Khambatta — FitStar Contributor</p>
<p>In my last article <a title="What Happens to Muscles During Exercise?" href="http://fitstar.com/happens-muscles-exercise-2/" target="_blank">What Happens to Muscles After Exercise?</a> I wrote about what happens to your body in the post-exercise state.  In that article, I explained how tissues across your body are affected by exercise, and how your muscle acts like a nutrient sponge immediately following exercise.  Having a post-workout nutrition strategy is one of the most important things you can do for your athletic program, and having a solid post-workout nutrition plan can take your <a href="http://www.fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a> workouts to the next level.</p>
<p>Metabolically, exercise is an incredibly demanding job, and that’s exactly why your post-workout meal is in my opinion the most important meal of the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://staging.fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Apple-2.png"><img alt="Apple 2" src="http://staging.fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Apple-2.png" width="286" height="429" /></a></p>
<p>In this article, I will focus specifically on carbohydrate nutrition, and explain why the popular anti-carbohydrate wisdom can lead you astray.  Carb-restricted diets like the Atkins diet, the South Beach diet, the Zone diet, and the Paleo diet have taken center stage, resulting in a plethora of meal options high in both fat and protein.  But a careful look at carb-restricted diets shows that carbohydrates are not only intelligent but absolutely <b>required</b> for optimal athletic recovery.</p>
<p><b>Sufficient Glycogen is Critical For Athletic Recovery</b></p>
<p>During a single exercise session, actively exercised muscle tissue can deplete up to 60-70% of it’s stored glycogen.  In the absence of sufficient glycogen, the muscle tissue will act very lethargically.  This is one of the reasons you may feel tired after exercise &#8211; because the glycogen fuel tanks are running low.  And it’s important to understand that your muscle tissue is as good as useless when it’s fuel tanks are close to empty.</p>
<p>Only a limited amount of carbohydrates can be stored in the human body.  In the same way that the fuel tank in your car can only hold 10-15 gallons of fuel before it overflows, your muscle and liver can store on average 500g of carbohydrate, or the energy equivalent of about 2,000 kcal.  That’s just about enough energy to power a typical adult for 24 hours.</p>
<p><i>Refilling muscle glycogen stores immediately following exercise with easily digestible unrefined carbohydrates is a critical step for optimal athletic recovery. </i></p>
<p>Glycogen attracts water in a 3:1 ratio, which means that recovering muscle is three times as hungry for water as it is for glucose.  Eating carbohydrate-rich foods with high water content accelerates the refueling process, allowing you to exercise frequently.  Hydrated muscle tissue is also less likely to develop cramps, which are not only painful but can significantly slow down the recovery process.</p>
<p>Simply stated, more glycogen means more hydration.</p>
<p><i> </i><b>Choosing the Right Type of Carbohydrates &#8211; Refined and Unrefined Carbohydrates are Not Created Equal</b></p>
<p>So if carbohydrates aid in athletic recovery, then what types of foods should you be eating?  I like to think of carbohydrates as falling into one of two categories – refined or unrefined.  A carbohydrate-rich food is either refined or unrefined, but never both.</p>
<p><b>Refined Carbohydrates Explained</b></p>
<p><a href="http://staging.fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bread-2.png"><img alt="bread 2" src="http://staging.fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bread-2.png" width="452" height="316" /></a></p>
<p>Refined carbohydrates are carbohydrate-rich foods that require a manufacturing process in order to become edible, and cannot be eaten in their natural, unprocessed state.  These foods include grains, cereals, pastas, bread and artificial sweeteners, and include foods like wheat, corn, rice, barley, sorghum, oats, rye and millet.  Thousands of scientific articles are uncovering the damaging effects of refined carbohydrates on the human body, including:</p>
<p>-<a href="http://www.archevore.com/panu-weblog/2009/6/23/the-argument-against-cereal-grains.html#_jmp0_" target="_blank">Damage to the lining of the small and large intestines</a></p>
<p>-<a title="9 Steps to Perfect Health" href="http://chriskresser.com/9-steps-to-perfect-health-1-dont-eat-toxins" target="_blank">Leaky gut syndrome (intestinal permeability)</a></p>
<p>-Celiac disease (gluten intolerance)</p>
<p>-Insulin resistance in the muscle and liver</p>
<p>-Excessive fat accumulation in the liver</p>
<p>-Increased fat accumulation (weight gain, obesity)</p>
<p>-Impaired cognitive function in the brain</p>
<p>-Increased prevalence of autoimmune conditions</p>
<p>It is exactly these types of carbohydrates which give ALL carbohydrates a bad name.  Clearly, the research shows that eating refined carbohydrates has severe metabolic consequences, and can result in excessive weight gain, autoimmunity, impaired cognition, insulin resistance, intestinal permeability and fatty liver.</p>
<p>But what about unrefined carbohydrates?  Do they pose the same threat?<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Unrefined Carbohydrates Explained</b></p>
<p><a href="http://staging.fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Potatoes-2.png"><img alt="Potatoes 2" src="http://staging.fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Potatoes-2.png" width="451" height="301" /></a></p>
<p>Unrefined carbohydrates are derived from plant sources, and include fruits, vegetables, starchy tubers and legumes.  They are considered unrefined because they can be eaten in their natural state, and require minimal processing, if any at all.</p>
<p>Unrefined carbohydrates are powerful additions to your diet for many reasons, and much of their superior nutrition stems from the fact that they contain not only carbohydrates, but water, vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants.  The presence of these non-caloric nutrients drastically affects the speed at which they are digested and absorbed, resulting in a slower release of glucose into the bloodstream.  In addition, foods that are “starchy” contain long chain carbohydrates that require more time to break down than do short chain carbohydrates.  This is exactly why they are recommended for sustained energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of both simple and complex carbohydrates, and provide ample glucose to aid restoring glycogen content.  Fruits and vegetables have a direct impact on muscle health, including:</p>
<p>-A high water content, to aid in glycogen resynthesis</p>
<p>-Bioavailable antioxidants, to aid in the clearance of free radicals formed in the mitochondria during aerobic exercise</p>
<p>-Essential vitamins and minerals, to aid in protein and DNA synthesis</p>
<p>-Small quantities of essential fatty acids (EFAs) with potent anti-inflammatory effects</p>
<p><b>Take Home Message</b></p>
<p>Simply stated, more glycogen means more energy throughout the day and more energy for exercise.  I’m always amazed at the tangible difference that eating more fresh fruits and vegetables can produce in as little as 1-2 weeks.  The difference is quite noticeable, and most people report that their energy levels are larger and more sustained.  If you’re a low-carb dieter and are looking for even more energy, try increasing your intake of unrefined carbohydrates and see the difference it makes.</p>
