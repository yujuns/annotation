				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Jeff Angus – FitStar Contributor</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I will be sharing my four favorite fitness and health maxims with you: <strong>specificity</strong>, <strong>recovery</strong>, <strong>consistency</strong>, and <strong>progressive overload</strong>. Regardless of your current fitness level or your health goal(s), these four maxims are vital to creating and sustaining a successful and enjoyable long-term exercise plan.</p>
<p><b>What Is Specificity?</b></p>
<p><b>Specificity is the principle of training that states what you do in the gym should be relevant and appropriate to your desired outcome</b>. Training must go from general (at the beginning) to specific (as the program progresses).</p>
<p>For example, a typical NHL player will begin the off-season correcting any injuries or general movement issues from the previous season of wear and tear. By the end of the summer, that player will be skating again and working primarily on speed and power improvements that are very specific to skating and playing hockey.</p>
<p><b>Specificity</b> also implies that to become better at a particular exercise or skill, you must perform that exercise or skill. To become a good cyclist, you must get on your bike a lot. The point to take away is that a runner should train by running and a swimmer should train by swimming. But if you are just training to get stronger or in better shape, how can you use specificity to aid your progress?</p>
<p>As Aristotle said, excellence isn’t an act but a habit. You are what you repeatedly do. Don’t expect to get faster if you are only bench pressing, and conversely, don’t expect your bench press to get better if you are only doing hill sprints.</p>
<p>Most people ignore the specificity principle when putting together their own workout programs (or even worse, when aimlessly going to the gym a few times a week). Don’t get me wrong, <b>doing something active is better than nothing</b>, but if you are in the fitness game for the long haul, you need to set some specific goals to stay engaged, track progress, and enjoy the journey.</p>
<p><strong>Why Does This Matter?</strong></p>
<p>Because there is never going to be a day when you are fully and completely satisfied with your fitness level and decide to “quit” exercising. <b>There is no end date to health.</b></p>
<p>Charles Poloquin, known in fitness circles as the godfather of program design, offers his specificity principle definition: &#8220;<i>Specificity refers to developing a particular athletic quality in the manner in which it occurs in a particular sport.&#8221;</i><i> </i></p>
<p>Obviously the better you get at a sport, the more specific your training has to be. The weekend warrior or the average person just wanting to get “in shape” doesn’t need to have workouts that are as specific as an NHL player for a professional power lifter.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Specificity-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4654" alt="Specificity 1" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Specificity-1.jpg" width="434" height="241" /></a></p>
<p>For training to be effective, it should be similar to the demands of the sport. Usually, the more specific the training, the better the transfer to sports performance. Although that last statement may be true, many strength and conditioning professionals including myself believe non-specific training should also take place in a training program not only to achieve a higher level of ability but for also injury prevention. Keep in mind, training first started to prevent injury, and later professionals discovered that training can also improve performance.</p>
<p><b>Let’s Look At A Few Examples: </b></p>
<p>If you want a big and strong chest/upper body, there aren’t many better exercises than the bench press (or <a title="weighted pushups" href="http://www.anguscertified.com/why-you-should-do-weighted-pushups/">weighted pushups</a>). But hockey players and baseball players don’t need to bench press on a regular basis. In fact, for many baseball players, there are underlying shoulder issues (mostly related to overuse) that make the bench press a potentially dangerous exercise.</p>
<p>And while having specific exercises helps in terms of improving sport performance, there are general or global demands that all human beings – regardless of their fitness pursuits – need to have. General strength and power, good posture and core stability, and mobility and stability at all of the major joints are all requirements to a healthy and functional body, especially in an athletic environment. Almost any person on Earth stands to benefit from squatting (with different variations, loads, and intensities, of course) and/or deadlifting.</p>
<p>Another example – to get a stronger wrist shot, many people think they need to be doing wrist curls. Specific? Sure. But effective? Not really.</p>
<p>All human beings squat and deadlift every single day (they just don’t know it). Picking up a box? That is a deadlift (usually with bad form). Getting up or sitting down? Hello box squat. Starting your lawn mower? That is a single arm row, using both back and core muscles to generate rotational power. Carrying groceries in from the car? That is a farmer’s walk, which places a huge demand on the core and upper back.</p>
<p><b>The Trade-Off Of The Specificity Principle:</b></p>
<p>However, there is always a trade-off with the specificity principle. If you are focusing on a particular sport or movement, you are going to neglect other areas of fitness. For example, if you only train in the endurance repetition range (higher reps, lighter weights), you won’t make significant strength or hypertrophic gains. And if you are training to squat or deadlift as much as you can, you won’t improve on your 10k time as much as if you were doing intervals, speed work, and higher repetition training with weights.</p>
<p><strong>Simply put, you have to focus on something during your workouts if you want to see long term gains</strong>. If you are new to the gym, you will see improvements doing almost anything, as your body isn’t used to having to work very hard. But once you make some progress, it becomes harder to break through each plateau. And this is where the specificity principle and goal-setting both come in to play.</p>
<p><b>Some Thoughts From Dean Somerset:</b></p>
<p><i>Workout consistently with a goal in mind. Stick with a program for at LEAST a few weeks to see noticeable progress. Switch it up when you want to work on something else, or when your gains start to stall (you’ll see this with a workout journal where you can record your lifts, weights, etc, and see if you’re making progress or not). Any program you do will get you results, IF it focuses on specific adaptation to imposed demands, and NOT if it focuses on non-existent terms like “muscle confusion.”</i></p>
<p><b>How To Get Specific:</b></p>
<p>Hopefully you haven’t been lulled to sleep just yet. How can you make your training specific? Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<p><b>1. Find a good gym in your area, and go in for a fitness assessment.</b> If possible, do some reading on the coach or trainer first to see their credentials or background. An assessment (like the Functional Movement Screen, or many coaches have developed their own) will show you your weak points and what you need to improve on to avoid injury. The Fit Test within <a href="http://www.fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a> is also a good starting point and will recommend a program you can start doing on your own within the app.</p>
<p><b>2. Pick a goal or two.</b> If you want to become a better runner, focus on exercises that will help with that. If you want to get ripped for the beach, focus on hard, full-body conditioning workouts (and clean up your diet… stat).</p>
<p><b>3. Track your progress</b>. Weekly or biweekly pictures are a great way to do this. The camera doesn’t lie (the scale, contrary to popular belief, often does). Write down your workouts – what exercises you did, what weights you used, and how you felt during and after. This is another way to tangibly see your progress.</p>
<p>Why I don’t like the scale – your weight has little to do with health and body composition (assuming you aren’t obese). You could weigh 160 pounds and be severely out of shape, and after a year of training and eating well, you could add 15 pounds of muscle and be a much healthier 175 or 180 pounds.</p>
<p><b>4. KISS. Keep It Simple, Stupid.</b> The more complex your training program, the less likely you are to follow it. You don’t need to do 10 to 12 exercises every time you go in the gym. And you don’t need to time your rest periods down to the second (unless you are an elite athlete). Learn the important lifts from a trainer or coach (or a friend), and get really good at them. If you have extra time, you can add in the accessory work – bicep curls, and so on. But that stuff isn’t essential.</p>
