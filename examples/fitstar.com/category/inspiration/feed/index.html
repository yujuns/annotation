				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laura began using <a href="http://fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a> four months ago when she learned about it during her PE class. She has since traded in 11 pounds for a lot more confidence!</p>
<p>Here are five facts you need to know about <strong>FitStar: Laura Walsh</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Laura-Walsh-Before-After.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5014" alt="Laura Walsh Before &amp; After" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Laura-Walsh-Before-After.png" width="490" height="490" /></a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>1) What’s your name and where do you live?</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Laura Walsh and I&#8217;m from Burgess Hill, West Sussex.</p>
<p><strong>2) How long have you been using FitStar and what Program do you use?</strong></p>
<p>I have been using FitStar for 4 months and I love the Freestyle Sessions because you don&#8217;t just do the same exercises &#8211; you get to do new moves you may not have heard of. It&#8217;s much better than fitness DVDs and you can do it in the contort of your own home which is way, way better than driving for at least 30 minutes to the gym.</p>
<p><strong>3) What’s your FitStar story?</strong></p>
<p>I was in my PE class, and my teacher said that we had to download one of nine fitness apps. FitStar was on there, so I downloaded it onto my iPad because I thought it looked really good and the positive comments made me think, wow, I really should try out this app. I wanted a fitness app that had a personal coach (that&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyGonzalez88">Tony Gonzalez</a>). He&#8217;s motivating and gives you helpful tips on how to do the moves correctly.</p>
<p>Before I used FitStar, I felt I could not do what a lot of people did. This all changed after I started using the app. Before I started, I was about 10 stone (140lbs), now I&#8217;m 9 stone (126 lbs) and I have lost 11bs (roughly) in total, which I&#8217;m quite proud of! I am continuing to work towards three goals in FitStar Challenges &#8211; I was so close to one of them, so I am rematching myself to see if I can beat my goal.</p>
<p><strong>4) Why is FitStar is a good fit for you?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good fit because I don&#8217;t need to go to the gym and I can do it in the confront of my own home, in my own time. And whatever day it is, I know Tony will be there every step of the way to support and guide me through the workouts. I am also really glad that FitStar allows me to workout at my own pace.</p>
<p><strong>5) What have you gained by using FitStar?</strong></p>
<p>I have gained a lot of self confidence. Many people say to me: &#8220;Laura, you&#8217;ve lost weight, have you been to the gym? Have you been eating smaller portions? Have you been taking any diet pills?&#8221; I say NO to all of those answers. I say I&#8217;ve been using the FitStar app! I truly recommend FitStar to any of my friends who are trying to get fit or just want to be stronger.</p>
<p>Way to go Laura!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi All &#8211;</p>
<p>Hard to believe, but it has been a year since we officially launched the first version of <a href="http://fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a>.</p>
<p>It started with a simple idea: by making fitness more convenient, inspirational and personal, we could do a better job of getting people moving &#8212; whatever their current state of fitness. In short, we wanted to put a personal trainer on your iPhone.</p>
<p>When we starting looking into consumer fitness options, we saw that DVD workouts really haven’t changed since the original Jane Fonda workouts from 1982. While some do a good job of showing people what to do, they&#8217;re static experiences that don&#8217;t evolve and change with you.  We saw the same phenomenon with other video-based fitness apps and utilities that prevail in the marketplace. Out of this realization, and a lot of hard work, FitStar was born.</p>
<p>Our mission is simple: to inspire people to live healthier lives. And our goal is to revolutionize the way people exercise and deliver a personalized, digital fitness experience that could be used anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>We couldn’t have picked a better debut partner and fitness guru than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Gonzalez_(American_football)">Tony Gonzalez</a>. There&#8217;s nobody we could think of that&#8217;s lived a more authentic life of health &#8211; it shows with his longevity and success on and off the field. We’re grateful he’s a part of our FitStar story, and we&#8217;re just getting started.</p>
<p>The best part of this amazing journey? It’s working. People are using FitStar and getting real results &#8211; while improving their health and well-being. We’ve heard great stories from people around the world of pounds lost and confidence gained. That’s what keeps US motivated.</p>
<p>Watch our &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; <a href="https://vimeo.com/fitstar/review/97476019/d70c5c1854">video</a> for a walk down memory lane.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/97476019" height="281" width="500" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><em>Music credit: Coldplay</em></p>
<p>I’m humbled to say that, to date, well over 1 million people have downloaded the first app developed for our platform: <em><strong>FitStar Personal Trainer</strong></em>, and more than 150 million calories have been collectively burned by our FitStars. As you can see below, we have some really cool, fun stats earned by our users around the world. So today, we celebrate a lot of hard work by our internal team &#8211; but also our dedicated FitStars everywhere. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without you.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1-YearInfoGraphic_FINAL_FULL.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4965" alt="1-YearInfoGraphic_FINAL_FULL" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1-YearInfoGraphic_FINAL_FULL.png" width="560" height="2680" /></a></p>
<p>Thank you for joining us on this journey and we hope you continue to get as much out of FitStar as we put in. There is much more to come.</p>
<p>Mike</p>
<p>CEO/Co-founder</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We heard about Sam&#8217;s &#8220;7 Day Challenge with FitStar&#8221; when he <a href="https://twitter.com/samatrouh/status/467210324387446784">tweeted</a> about it earlier this month. Being a shy and introverted person means he&#8217;s not as comfortable in the gym setting. We love that Sam gave <a href="http://fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a> a shot and asked him to share his experience. Spoiler alert: It&#8217;s been over 7 days and he&#8217;s <em>still</em> using FitStar!</p>
<p>Here are five facts you need to know about <strong>FitStar: Sam Matrouh</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FitStarStories_WallPost_SamMatrouh.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4833" alt="FitStarStories_WallPost_SamMatrouh" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FitStarStories_WallPost_SamMatrouh.png" width="674" height="375" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>1) What’s your name and where do you live?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Sam and I’m a Sydney-based web designer and developer.</p>
<p><strong>2) How long have you been using FitStar and what Program do you use?</strong></p>
<p>I received one free week of FitStar Premium so I went on a 7-day challenge to try it out using the Get Strong Program.</p>
<p><strong>3) What is your FitStar story?</strong></p>
<p>Being in a long-term relationship with a foodie and chef isn’t exactly the most diet-friendly thing in this world. Imagine having restaurant quality food, three meals a day, six days a week and then going restaurant hopping on the 7th day. As we settled in and got comfortable in our relationship, so did the extra couple kilos around my waist.</p>
<p>Being a big muscular guy has never been on my priority list, but I take fitness seriously and the beginnings of a beer belly in the mirror seemed like a pretty good sign that I should do something about it.</p>
<p>So I started going to the gym, but two months down the track and a few hundred dollars later, I realized that the gym experience was not for me. This was mainly due to the lack of proper training, overcomplicated equipment and my introverted personality.</p>
<p>I won’t bore you with the full story here, but if you have a few spare minutes you can read it on <a href="https://medium.com/geek-fit/my-7-day-challenge-with-fitstar-intro-db07bb3374f2">medium.com</a>. The strangest part of my 7-day journey was the day I stepped on the scale. I had lost .5kg (that&#8217;s about 1 pound), but I felt like I’ve done nothing to deserve this. That was an amazing feeling.</p>
<p><strong>4) Why is FitStar a good fit for you?</strong></p>
<p>One of the best parts of using FitStar was that I didn’t have to have a routine. It took zero planning on my end. I just had to put on my shoes and press play. Everything else was taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>5) What have you gained by using FitStar?</strong></p>
<p>It didn’t take me long to realize that FitStar was just the thing for me. I had an intelligent personal trainer that challenged me as I progressed. I didn’t need any equipment to start, and best of all, I got to do everything from the comfort of my own home. No uncomfortable overcrowded gyms with intimidatingly fit and social people.</p>
<p>Generally if I use something for a week or so and I’m still excited about it, it’s a solid indication that I’m not going to change my mind anytime soon. It’s been just over two weeks since I started using FitStar and well, I guess I’m not stopping anytime soon.</p>
<p>Way to go Sam &#8211; we hope you keep us posted on your progress!</p>

<p>I love that I can use FitStar almost anywhere, anytime. I also love that it changes things up (no boredom here) and progresses with you. It&#8217;s amazing when you look back and see how far you&#8217;ve come! Last week I did an incline press. I was so proud that I did it!</p>

<p>Here are five facts you need to know about <strong>FitStar: Laura Jenkins</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Laura-Jenkins.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3983" alt="Laura Jenkins" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Laura-Jenkins.jpg" width="537" height="537" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1) What&#8217;s your name and where do you live?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Laura Jenkins and I&#8217;m from Camano Island WA.</p>
<p><strong>2) How long have you been using FitStar and what Program do you use?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using FitStar for 5 months and I started with Get Lean. Now, I&#8217;m using Get Strong.</p>
<p><strong>3) What is your FitStar story? </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lost 23 lbs and went from a size 14 to size 6! I am a small business owner, so usually I go 2-3 weeks in between visits with clients. They go nuts every time I see them. I&#8217;ve even heard people say they didn&#8217;t recognize me. So, thank YOU FitStar for this amazing program.</p>
<p><strong>4) Why is FitStar is a good fit for you?</strong></p>
<p>FitStar is so convenient with my schedule and 4 year old son. I don&#8217;t have to find childcare, and I can workout from home or on vacation. There is very little cost. And the workouts are simple enough to follow.</p>
<p><strong>5) What have you gained by using FitStar?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest thing I&#8217;ve gained by using FitStar is confidence and self worth. I do feel much healthier and stronger. I can fit into clothing I never thought I would be able to. I&#8217;m empowered to become the person I&#8217;ve always wanted to be not only on the inside, but on the outside!!</p>
<p>Way to go Laura!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re inspired every day by the work our FitStars put in and love hearing about how our app is changing lives for the better! So we launched <strong>#FitStarStories</strong> as a way to share motivating results with our entire community.</p>
<p>Blake has been using <a href="http://www.fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a> exclusively for two months and has lost 20 pounds! Here are five facts you need to know about <strong>FitStar: Blake Woody</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Blake-Image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3936" alt="Blake Image" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Blake-Image.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1) What&#8217;s your name and where do you live? </strong></p>
<p>My name is Blake Woody and I live in a small town called Clyde in North Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>2) How long have you been using FitStar?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using Fitstar on and off for about 3 months now but, as of 2 months ago I switched over to using it full time as my main workout regimen.</p>
<p><strong>3) What is your FitStar story? </strong></p>
<p>In January of 2014 I started back on the Insanity program from Beach Body after almost a year of no working out. I lost about 15 lbs in two months but was getting bored with the same routines every week. I needed a change. I had used FitStar before but not religiously. I decided to take the plunge and go all in. I signed up for the membership at $5/month and haven&#8217;t looked back. I also use a <a href="http://jawbone.com">Jawbone</a> UP24 to track my movement each day and <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com">MyFitnessPal</a> to track my caloric intake. Both services work hand in hand with FitStar which makes a great experience overall. Since joining FitStar full time as my workout program I&#8217;ve lost about 20 pounds. In January I weighed in at 205 pounds. Today, I weigh 171, have much better muscle tone throughout my whole body, and my cardio is through the roof.</p>
<p><strong>4) Why is FitStar a good fit for you?</strong></p>
<p>It works well with other services I use such as the Jawbone UP24 and MyFitnessPal. I also love the Freestyle Sessions to change things up from time to time. I find them fun. Some days I don&#8217;t want to follow my Get Lean Program so I find myself completing 2-3 Freestyle Sessions for a couple of days. It&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>Completing a workout is the first thing I do immediately after breakfast in the comfort of my own living room. No driving to the gym and no expensive workout equipment. Just $5/month and some dedication gets me right.</p>
<p><strong>5) What have you gained by using FitStar?</strong></p>
<p>More energy since I work two jobs that total about 13-14 hrs 6 days a week, energy is something I need. My clothes also fit much better and overall I feel better. I&#8217;m probably in the best shape of my life and I haven&#8217;t stepped foot in a gym or on a treadmill all year. All I need is open space and my iPhone, then I&#8217;m good to go.</p>
<p>Way to go Blake!</p>
