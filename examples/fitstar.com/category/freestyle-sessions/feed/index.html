<p><a href="http://www.fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a> is an ideal solution for getting in a great workout when you’re short on time, but we’re also there for you when you’re short on space. For our latest FreeStyle Session, we teamed up with our friends at <a href="http://greatist.com">Greatist</a> to bring you the <a href="http://greatist.com/move/wherever-workout-video">Greatist Wherever Workout </a>which checks both of these boxes &#8211; while also introducing five new exercises, as well as the return of Warm-Up and Cool Down Moves.</p>
<p>With the Greatist Wherever Workout, you can move through a total-body 20-minute Session in your apartment, dorm, office, outside, or anywhere you’re feeling the fitness. And you can get it done without any equipment, while also taking it easy on your joints and those hardwood floors. That means your neighbors (and your muscles) are going to love these Moves!</p>
<p>You’ll kick things off with a couple Warm-Ups to get your blood moving, and then your fists will be flying with Shadow Boxing &#8211; our latest addition to the Cardio category. Elbow Plank Pushups will chisel your chest while recruiting your core, and Spidermans will make sure your abs and obliques get a little extra love. Back Planks is another simple exercise with a ton of great benefits, including a stronger back, triceps, shoulders, core, and quads &#8211; just make sure you keep those hips high!</p>
<p>Don’t let a lack of time or space stand in the way of your fitness fun &#8211; check out the intro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0tRyJQZngc&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> below and then give the Greatist Wherever Workout a try today. This Session is FREE for all FitStars so there’s no excuse not to Make it Happen!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re all trying to find a little balance in our lives &#8211; why not start with <i>Rock Steady</i>, our latest Premium Freestyle Session? This 20-minute workout focuses on building strong balance and stability &#8211; key foundations for any athletic movement, while also acting as a great way to offset long days spent slouching behind a desk.</p>
<p><i>Rock Steady</i> is designed from a collection of time-based low-impact bodyweight Moves &#8211; a popular community request &#8211; making it ideal for beginners, those with joint pain, or FitStars with neighbors downstairs or a sleeping baby in the next room. And because the exercises are time-based (instead of rep-based), even the most seasoned FitStar can challenge their fitness throughout the 15 different Moves.</p>
<p>From Warrior 3 Kickouts to Superman Planks to Floor Bridge, you’ll get your body’s stabilizer muscles firing, with a little extra burn for your abs, back, legs, and obliques. You’ll be building a better foundation, 20 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>To add a little balance to everyone’s lives, this Premium Freestyle Session will be FREE for all FitStars through April 21st.</p>
<p>Give <i>Rock Steady</i> a try today!</p>
<p>Keep Moving!</p>
<p>-Team FitStar</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A solid core’s good for more than just looking great in your swimsuit (or your latest selfie). Strong abs, obliques, and lower back are also core to overall body fitness (see what we did there?). Every athletic movement benefits from these foundational muscles &#8211; from burpees to pushups in your favorite FitStar Session, to running, swinging a golf club, or perfecting your dolphin pose in your other fit pastimes.</p>
<p>You’ve heard of 8-minute abs; enter our latest Freestyle Session, <em>10-Minute Abs</em>. This quick and effective midsection-molding workout serves as a great complement to your regular Program Sessions when you want just a little more core, are short on time, or as perfect prep for shedding sweater weather for swimsuit season.</p>
<p>With nine unique moves across ten minutes, you can crush your core in less time than it takes to bake a pizza or find an open abs machine at the gym. While the Superman Planks into Side Planks into Windshield Wipers is our favorite series in the Session, closing things out with an intense thirty seconds of Mountain Climbers comes in at a close second on the stomach-shredding scale!</p>
<p>To officially kick off core-scultpting season and the first full week of Spring, <strong>10-Minute Abs will be free for all FitStars through March</strong>!</p>
<p>So fire up <a href="http://fitstar.com/download">FitStar</a> on your iPhone or iPad and give <em>10-Minute Abs</em> a shot today &#8211; your future fitness, and selfies, will thank you.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Show your muscles some love with our latest Premium Freestyle Session, <em>Date Night</em>. This new, twelve-minute workout marks the debut of Warm Up Moves to kick-off your Session, giving those muscles, tendons, and ligaments a little extra TLC. Although you won’t see Warm Ups in your Session Preview or Summary just yet, consider them an “under the radar” addition to help you get ready for the workout.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Date Night</em> also introduces two brand-new bodyweight Moves into the mix to change things up and keep you on your toes, literally. <em>Up Downs</em> is a Tony-favorite and a great staple for overall body conditioning – just make sure you keep those feet moving and give this one a go on a soft surface. We’ve also added <em>Reverse Grip Pushups</em> to really tone your triceps and strengthen your upper body – wave goodbye to those under arm wings!</p>
<p dir="ltr">With those two Moves combined with eight others, you’ve got a quick and dynamic total body workout to have you looking great and feeling great – from abs to calves to butt to back – it’s perfect prep for ordering that date night steak, or breaking out that little black dress.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And to show all FitStars some love this Valentine&#8217;s Day, we’re making <em>Date Night</em> free through Sunday, February 16th.</p>
<p>So get your heart, and confidence, pumping by giving <em>Date Night</em> a try today!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know that keeping things fresh is the key to staying with any fitness routine, so we’re busy working on new Moves and Sessions to get 2014 off to a fit start. Our newest Freestyle Session, Alpine Blitz, is now available for all <a href="http://app.fitstar.com/redirect">FitStar Premium</a> subscribers.</p>
<p>Whether you’re hitting the mountain or hitting the mall, this 17 minute Session has you covered with 7 all-new bodyweight moves and a focus on legs, core, cardio, and overall balance and stability &#8211; perfect for tackling moguls or fitting into your swimsuit when you trade the snowboard for the surfboard.</p>
<p><a href="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Superman-Planks-Tony.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1771" alt="Superman Planks - Tony" src="http://fitstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Superman-Planks-Tony.jpg" width="1280" height="720" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of all the new Moves in Alpine Blitz:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bicycle Kicks</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jump Lunges</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spiderman Pushups</strong></li>
<li><strong>Squat Walk</strong></li>
<li><strong>Star Crawl</strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="line-height: 13px;">Star Skaters</span></strong></li>
<li><strong>Superman Planks</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While our handcrafted Freestyle Sessions don’t dynamically change like those in your chosen Program (e.g., Daily Dose, Get Strong, etc.), they’re still a great way to get in a quick workout or target a specific muscle group while progressing towards your fitness goals. And very soon, we&#8217;ll be adding these Moves into all of the Programs to add variety and keep you on track.</p>
<p>Alpine Blitz is one of our Premium Member offerings.  If you&#8217;re using FitStar Basic, now&#8217;s a great time to upgrade to Premium while our Annual Pass is 40% off. FitStar Premium grants you unlimited access to our entire range of Freestyle Sessions and Programs like Get Lean and Get Strong.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this limited-time offer, simply <a href="http://app.fitstar.com/redirect">launch FitStar</a> on your mobile device, click on the menu icon, select Programs, and select Get it All with Premium.</p>
<p>Give Alpine Blitz a try and let us know <a href="mailto:support@fitstar.com"> your thoughts</a>. We hope to see you all at the top of the mountain!</p>
<p>Keep moving,</p>
<p>Team FitStar</p>
