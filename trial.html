                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Thank you for participating in this exercise. No worries.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">No worries.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">As I said, this is going to be used for teaching purposes in the website attached to this book. </span><span class="sentence">Rest assured it will be anonymised and in the best of possible taste.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yes. That’ s fine.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">So this is the first one I’ve done as well.</span><span class="sentence"> We’re really asking people who’ve been born in Australia to say a bit about being Australian.</span><span class="sentence"> So could I just ask you to begin with where you are from and how you came to live in Hobart?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I was born in Hobart and I’ve lived here my whole life and both my parents were born in Tasmania as well.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">And grandparents, just out of interest?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I think, um, they definitely did on my mum’s side and I think one of my dad’s parents did—was born in Tasmania as well but one wasn’t.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">And just where do you live in Hobart?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">In Glenorchy. </span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">What are the things you like about Tasmania?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">No I suppose because I’ve lived here my whole life it’s familiar and I’ve just turned eighteen so when I go out I mix, like, a lot—most of the people out I know and I’m friends with and the kind of social networks are quite dense.</span><span class="sentence"> Does that make sense?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Yes.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Oh, and I like the environment as well.</span><span class="sentence"> I spend a lot of time, like, at the beach and bushwalking and things like that.</span><span class="sentence"> So it’s ideal for that kind of thing.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">It is.</span><span class="sentence"> If I said what do you like about Australia, is it the same question for you?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">No.</span><span class="sentence"> I don’t think it is.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">How would you answer that question then?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Um—that’s hard I think.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">You are Australian.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yes. </span><span class="sentence">(Laughs) I suppose—um, I haven’t travelled that much.</span><span class="sentence"> I have travelled a bit, so I can’t really compare it that well but when I go overseas it’s a lot more—I spent a year living in Japan and the lifestyle is so much more hectic and a lot more—going to a Japanese school there was so much pressure and—I don’t know.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Was that in a city in Japan?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah, in Tokyo. </span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">In terms of saying what do you like about Tasmania, which I started with, have you been to the mainland enough in Australia to know whether it’s different to the mainland?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence"> Not really enough to know what a fun-going lifestyle would be like there.</span><span class="sentence"> I haven’t spent long periods of time there.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">But do you see it differently to mainland?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Um, I suppose—when I—I recently spent a week and a half in Queensland with some of my friends and we spent a fair bit of time going out to pubs and clubs there.</span><span class="sentence"> When you go out there it’s a really different scene.</span><span class="sentence"> It seems like people aren’t really there to meet their friends or relax on the weekend.</span><span class="sentence"> It’s a lot more fast-paced.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">That’s what you said before, didn’t you?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">You think they don’t know each other as well ...</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">... when they go out to pubs and clubs there.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I suppose it’s more about meeting new people there rather than consolidating friendships like it is here.</span><span class="sentence"> But I’m not really one to speak.</span><span class="sentence"> I don’t have a lot of experience and it’s a bit hard to compare going to Queensland for a couple of weeks with living in Japan for a year.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">OK, Japan is obviously a very different kind of culture anyway.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yes.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">So it’s very hard to compare what the nightclubs are like in Japan.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah. I was too young when I went there anyway. </span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">You were.</span><span class="sentence"> Some of these questions are hard to answer, what are the things you like about it, but I’m almost thinking: what are the things you don’t like about Tasmania?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I don’t like the—there’s not a lot I don’t like about it.</span><span class="sentence"> I was talking to a friend the other day about transferring to a Melbourne university and when they asked why would I leave, like, why would I give up my parents paying all my bills and things like that.</span><span class="sentence"> I was saying it just gets a bit boring.</span><span class="sentence"> Like, I’ve seen everything there is to see in Hobart and I know that if I want to buy new clothes I know exactly which shops to go to and I don’t go and, like, browse around.</span><span class="sentence"> On the weekends I kind of know what I will end up doing.</span><span class="sentence"> It’s not— there’ s not a lot of variety.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">So, it’s been in part a good thing because you see all the same people.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah, in some ways.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">And I suppose the opposite you could say—you said it was fast overseas, you could say it’s slow here.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">You do see it that way?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence"> class="sentence"That’s a good thing?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Oh, yeah.</span><span class="sentence"> Depends which way you look at it.</span><span class="sentence"> It’s safe and comfortable but not very stimulating kind of thing.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">You said that.</span><span class="sentence"> Some people say that.</span><span class="sentence"> Well anyway, this is basically trying to talk about what is it—get at what’s being like an Australian.</span><span class="sentence"> [6:50] One way of looking at it is looking at what you do on the most important Australian days of the year, some people say.</span><span class="sentence"> What did you do on Anzac Day this year? Did you do anything?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">No.</span><span class="sentence"> Nothing out of the ordinary.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Do you normally do anything?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Not on Anzac Day, no.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Do your family do anything?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I don’t think so.</span><span class="sentence"> Oh, wait.</span><span class="sentence"> Probably watch the football.</span><span class="sentence"> Yeah, that would be about the extent of it.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER</span><span class="sentence">Anzac Day is just an example.</span><span class="sentence"> Does it mean anything special to you or is it just another day or holiday?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I can appreciate the significance of it and understand why it’s important but it doesn’t really affect my life.</span><span class="sentence"> Like I’m not—yeah.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">What about Australia Day?</span><span class="sentence"> Do you do anything special on that?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">This year a friend had a barbecue and drinks and all that kind of thing.</span><span class="sentence">Blow-up pools and...</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Was that to celebrate being Australian or was it just having another holiday?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">A bit of both, I guess.</span><span class="sentence">Yeah, people would dress up in Australian clothes and Australian music and things like that.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Oh, they do? </span><span>Right, that’s interesting.</span><span class="sentence"> What kind of clothes do they wear?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Green and gold and flags and face paint. </span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Did you do it as well?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Y eah, yep.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">That’s pretty interesting in terms of doing something concrete—identity.</span><span class="sentence">What about supporting the sports teams?</span><span class="sentence"> Like, seeing the Olympics at the moment; are you very interested in seeing how the Australians are doing?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Um, yeah.</span><span class="sentence"> It interests me.</span><span class="sentence"> I suppose this relates back especially to hockey because of the Tasmanian players in the team, so it’s more about knowing of people from here.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Really?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I was saying before I’m friends with the players’ younger siblings and stuff like that so I follow it a fair bit.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence"> class="sentence"Have they done well?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah, they’re in the semi-finals.</span><span class="sentence"> Yeah, the Tasmanians have been going really well; scoring goals and ...</span class="sentence"></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Do you get together with your friends to watch the games or do you ...</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">No. Maybe if you’re on holiday and stuff like that.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">You’re not bothered that Australia’s got less gold medals than they had last time?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Doesn’t really worry me (laughs softly).</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Y ou’ ve been abroad. Y ou’ ve been to the mainland as well. How do you think people in other countries see Australia? Do you have a kind of impression?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Um ...</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span>Or Tasmania? I suppose we have to think of that as a separate question.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">When I was in Japan they didn’t really know—they wouldn’t have known where Tasmania was and in Japan Australia was less interesting because I went on exchange and at the same school there were exchange students from all over the world and Australia was kind of like less interesting than America and—where else were they from? America and Canada. </span><span class="sentence">But then I spent—I did an exchange in France as well and in France they were pretty fascinated by Australia.</span><span class="sentence"> A lot more so than the other countries.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Did they see it in a...</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Positive light?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Mm.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Y eah.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">For what reasons?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I can’t really tell you that.</span><span class="sentence"> I suppose they definitely saw Australia as the stereotypical Australia.</span><span class="sentence"> The beaches and always hot and stuff like that.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Somewhere you would want to live?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Of course, they’ve not been to T asmania.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Y eah. (Laughs) Probably not. [11:28]</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">No. I wonder whether they saw you as a typical Australian.</span><span class="sentence"> Do you think that was the case?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I don’t know.</span><span class="sentence"> Especially because my language things weren’t that good so it was hard to really get a proper understanding of each other.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Did they assume everyone was good at sport because you’re Australian?</span><span class="sentence"> Like swimming, you know.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah. Actually they did always think that we wanted to go to the pool and beaches and stuff but [indistinct].</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Except it is if you are really good at swimming anyway.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I’m not.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Because one of the things I found when I came to Tasmania was—I went to the swimming pool and I was amazed by how fast they were.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Really?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">The average person is a better swimmer.</span><span class="sentence"> That is a stereotype I have of Australians, really.</span><span class="sentence"> It says here, ‘Is this the correct perception?’ If they see it as a country of beaches and sunshine, is it a correct perception?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARITCIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I suppose in comparison to where they’re from it is.</span><span class="sentence"> I think it’s a lot—yeah.</span><span class="sentence"> Does that work as an answer; in comparison?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">I think so.</span><span class="sentence"> I suppose you could say Tasmania is not a very sunny place all the time, so maybe it’s not a correct perception.</span><span class="sentence"> It really depends how you think how people see it.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I’m sure—after I went over to France the girl who I stayed with came and lived with me for a while and I don’t think she was disillusioned before she came here. [13:33]</span><span class="sentence"> Like when she did come here towards—at about the start of summer so she saw Tasmania in its best light kind of thing.</span><span class="sentence"> But I don’t think she imagined that it was just beaches and kangaroos everywhere.</span><span class="sentence"> She had a fairly realistic view of it I think.</span><span class="sentence"> But also, when overseas visitors come here we show them things that are typically Australian—so we went to the wildlife park to look at the kangaroos and the Tassie devils, and we took her to Port Arthur to show where the convicts came to, we went camping at Bruny Island and spent time at the beach as well as showing her where Truganini was born.</span><span class="sentence"> We had lots of Aussie barbecues at the beach and back at home, so she got to experience what we think is important about being Australian, at the same time as seeing the way we live in a city like Hobart.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">The kangaroo is a symbol when you think of it.</span><span class="sentence"> It’s not that you see many round here.</span><span class="sentence"> Finally, can I just conclude by saying, after thinking about all that, what does being an Australian mean to you?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I suppose just—it’s quite a diverse lifestyle, I think.</span><span class="sentence"> In Australia there’s a lot of—for me there’s been kind of like a lot of pressure to do well, go to university and get a good job.</span><span class="sentence"> But there’s also been a lot of avenues for a leisure-filled lifestyle as well and maybe from my time overseas, not a lot of cultures have those two lifestyles combined so much.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Interesting.</span><span class="sentence"> Yeah, there’ s more pressure overseas and you perceive a [indistinct].</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Y eah. But that could be the experiences that I’ ve had, that I’ ve been able to combine them both.</span><span class="sentence"> That may not be the same for everyone.</span><span class="sentence"> But most of my friends would have had similar pressures in that we all have had to achieve well at school but also similar experiences of leisure—like we do go out on weekends, and we do make time for getting to the beach or for bushwalking.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah.</span><span class="sentence"> It’ s hard to know how much leisure time people have or how much it’ s the lifestyle here.</span><span class="sentence"> In a place like Tasmania I suppose you have more time than you would have in a big city where you’re travelling around all the time.</span><span class="sentence"> Maybe that’s what you’re ...</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I’m not sure, it does help that everything is so close here. But ...</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Do you fancy going abroad later on?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah, I do want to but I don’t know when, really.</span><span class="sentence"> I’ll go as soon as I can but I don’t want to just have to, like, squeeze it all into uni holidays or semester break or something or I’ll never be able to do it.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">By abroad, I mean there’s either the mainland or further afield.</span><span class="sentence"> Both are interesting?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">Yeah. Both are interesting.</span><span class="sentence"> Probably the mainland.</span><span class="sentence"> If I was going to move there it would be while I’m at uni rather than after but abroad I’d probably wait till after uni.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">You can’t say which country you’d like?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">I would say Europe.</span><span class="sentence"> Yeah. That’s about as specific as I can get.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Good answer.</span><span class="sentence"> It’s where I come from.</span><span class="sentence"> Now is there anything else that you’d like to add that we haven’t covered?</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">PARTICIPANT:</span><span class="sentence">No, I don’t think so.</span></p>
                <p><span class="role">INTERVIEWER:</span><span class="sentence">Thank you very much for participating.</span></p>
